                <div>
                    <p class="theme__title">Segregation</p>
                    <p class="theme__desc">Segregation is, argaubly, the primary topic discussed in the book. Througout the book, the main focus was the inequality, discrimination, and horror that people of color faced. This is emphasized in the scene where Mr. Harvey was murdered.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="theme">
                <img src="./assets/images/courage__pic.jpg" alt="Picture of segregation">
                <div>
                    <p class="theme__title">Courage</p>
                    <p class="theme__desc">Courage is an important topic that is discussed in the book. The book emphasizes (especially in the beginning) a LACK of courage. This fear and lack of courage can be seen in Chapter 5, when Mr. Harvey is hung. The member's of the church were (understandably) afraid, and nobody was brave enough to help Mr. Harvey.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="theme">

                <div>
                    <p class="theme__title">Education</p>
                    <p class="theme__desc">The topic of Education is covered in multiple places in the book. One notable chapter in the book where this is shown is in Chapter 8. In chapter 8, Melba decides to concentrate on her education so she can finally escape Little Rock. This determination is likely what allowed her to be able to attend Little Rock High School.</p>

        <p class="s2title">
            The theme that is emphasized in the book is that <span>preserverance</span> and <span>determination</span> is key.
        </p>
        <div class="s2content">
            <p>The theme "preserverance and determination is key" is mentioned and implied a lot in the book "March Forward Girl". In the book, Melba had to show resilience and determination in order to break free of the bariers of segregation. A quote from Chapter 8 in the book is included below:</p>
            <p class="quote">                "Following the awful Saturday in Miss Lisa's pantry, I was commited to learning more about the white world and how it worked. I decided to read the newspaper that was delivered each day to our house..."

                <br>
                <span>Page 86. Chapter 8</span>
            </p>
            <p>Most people in Melba's situation would have broken down, or given up hope. However, Melba did neither of those things. Instead, she thought progressively, and devised a plan that she can follow in order to not get in the same situation again. This theme is portrayed multiple times in the book. Every time one way that Melba hoped to escape Little Rock was crushed, she found another way. This theme is something that everyone should learn from, since being determined and resilient is very helpful.</p>

            When the darkest claws of oppression strike
            <br>
            The worst trait to possess is arrogance
            <br>
            For when the injustice leaves you in plight
            <br>
            The best quality is intelligence
            <br>
            <br>
            Through determination and some hard work
            <br>
            And a vast supply of some good knowledge
            <br>
            The knowledge you have will become a perk
            <br>
            And your opressors will start to oblige
            <br>
            <br>
            You will, at last, get to feel and be free
            <br>
            And using your knowledge to support you
            <br>
            You'll leave the harsh reality and see
            <br>
            A world where you are seen as someone new
            <br>
            <br>
            So the question is asked, to you and me
            <br>
            What would you risk, in order to be free?

            <p>
                The sonnet above relates to "March Forward, Girl" in many aspects. The first thing that poses a similarity to the book can be found in stanzas 5-8:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                Through determination and some hard work
                <br>
                And a vast supply of some good knowledge
                <br>
                The knowledge you have will become a perk
                <br>
                And your opressors will start to oblige
                <br>

                <span>Stanzas 5-8, Sonnet</span>
            </p>

            <p>That exerpt shows how determination and knowledge while seem dreary to obtain at first, it will become a major advantage to you in the future. This is represented in the book, as Melba decides to concentrate on her education, which allowed her to attend Little Rock High School. A exerpt from the book is shown below:</p>
            <p class="quote">
                "I realized on more truth of Grandma's words: Sometimes you had to go where you weren't welcome. One woman's action on a single bus eventually led to the Montgomery bus boycott... It gave me hope that little rock could change."

                <br>
                <span>Page 209-210. Chapter 20</span>
            </p>
            <p>This exerpt proves that courage and determination are truly the key to sucess, and that when someone is able to work hard enough, they will be able to reach their goals.</p>
